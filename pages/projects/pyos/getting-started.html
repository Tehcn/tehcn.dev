    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    Creating an operating system is a project many programmers have thought of, but most chose not to try, and for those that do, most will give up soon after starting.
    My experience creating PyOS, was no different. I became motived, started, then was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer scope of an operating system.
    From having to make a bootloader and filesystem, to GUIs and multitasking, creating an operating system is no light feat.
