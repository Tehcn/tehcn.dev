    <h3>What is PyOS?</h3>
    PyOS is my attempt at creating an operating system. However, whereas most operating systems' kernels are written in C, mine will be written in Python.
    While this may seem like a bad choice, it provides an interesting challenge. To have it work I compile the python using Cython.

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    Some of my goals for PyOS include: full terminal, networking, desktop, GUI support, OpenGL support, support for modern graphics drivers, and more.
    Of course, each of these will be difficult to implement, the bugs and problems that I encounter along the way.
