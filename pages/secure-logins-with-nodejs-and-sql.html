    <h3>Some Background</h3>
    <p>
        I've seen some pretty atrocious code produced by amateur backend devs... of course, I was once one of these
        people. Thankfully, I often discuss projects I'm working on with my dad (who's been in the industry for decades)
        and he was able to correct some of my harmful practices. Some were worse than others, one of the worse ones
        being using JSON files as databases for user data. Worst of all, I stored passwords of my users in
        <i>plaintext</i>... yeah. So, this article exists to help new backend devs avoid some serious security flaws
        that many people experience.

    <h3>Step 1: Setup Code</h3>
    <p>
        To begin, if you want to follow along with the code you have to have NodeJS v12 or greater for it to be
        guaranteed to work (if you don't make any mistakes). This guide will NOT go over how to install NodeJS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Create a new folder wherever you store your code and open it however you like. Create a file called
        <code>index.js</code>, as this will be the entrypoint for our program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initialize npm
    <pre>

<code class="language-shell">$ npm init -y</code>

</pre>
    We will use the npm packages <code>mysql</code> and <code>express</code>
    <pre>

<code class="language-shell">$ npm i mysql express</code>

</pre>
    To finish setup, let's check that everything's working as expected
    <pre>

<code class="language-js">// index.js
const express = require('express');
const mysql = require('mysql');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello World!');
});

const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => { console.log(`server running on port ${port}`)});</code>

</pre>
    If that code runs without errors, and if you can (if you're working locally) visit <a
        href="http://localhost:300">http://localhost:3000/</a>, then, congratulations, you've finished half of the
    setup. Now, for the arguably harder part.

    <h3>Step 2: Setup SQL Server</h3>
    <p>
        If you already have SQL Server and SSMS setup, feel free to skip this step and move on to <a href="#step-3">Step
            3: Creating a Database and Tables</a> Anyway, goto <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads" target="_blank">MSSQL Downloads</a>,
        and download either the Express or Developer edition. Personally, I recommend that you use Express, since you
        can use it in production for free, unlike Developer. Finish installing MSSQL Server.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Download it <a
            href="https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup">here</a>. Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult to install, just
        follow the steps and do what it tells you to.

    <h3>Step 3: Creating a Database and Tables</h3>
    <p>
        First, we should create a new login, so our later program can actually connect to the database we are about to
        make. To do this open a T-SQL terminal and type the following command (replacing &lt;uname&gt; with the username
        you want the login to have)
    <pre>

<code class="language-sql">CREATE LOGIN &lt;uname&gt;
WITH PASSWORD = 'temppwd' MUST_CHANGE,  
CREDENTIAL = RestrictedFaculty,
CHECK_EXPIRATION = ON;
GO
</code>

</pre>
    Next we run the following snippet to create a user that we can give permissions to (replacing &lt;uname&gt; with
    whatever you called the login)
    <pre>

<code class="language-sql">CREATE USER &lt;uname&gt; FOR LOGIN &lt;uname&gt;;  
GO   
</code>

</pre>
    You should login from SSMS where you will gave to change the password. Make sure it's at least 16 characters long.
    </p>
    We are finally at the point where we should consider what demo to make to prove that we can actually make a
    functional project with these technologies. A good and relatively simple app to implement is a todo app, so let's do
    that!
    Creating a database is actually really simple. In SSMS, click the <code>New Query</code> button, and put the below
    snippet into the text window that appears
    <pre>

<code class="language-sql">CREATE DATABASE todoDB;
GO
</code>

</pre>
    Next, we'll create two tables: a user table and a todo table. Todo so (see what I did there) we'll run two queries.
    If you still have the query window open delete everything in it, otherwise click the <code>New Query</code> button
    again, and type the following statements
